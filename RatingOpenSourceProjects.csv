,,Discover Collectively Open Science Projects,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"A major appeal of Open Science is the capacity to harness collective intelligence and face big scientific challenges, unmet when researchers are working in isolation. Below is a list of such projects. Work your way through the list (up to you if you wish to divide and conquer, work in couples or as a group) to discover the projects. Apply your score (1-5 low-to-high score), using 10 of the Vienna Open Science Principles (Do read here: https://viennaprinciples.org/) to rank the projects’ ‘openness’. Add a few comments on what you appreciated and what you think could be improved in these projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Human Brain Project,Sharing neural datasets for interdisciplinary research,5,4,5,5,Need to learn more on how to test reproducibility of massive projects,5,4,4,Need to learn more on how to test evaluation of massive projects - especially as reviewing takes good amount of time to be able to verify data collection and analysis processes.,5,37,"Highly organized, easily accessible base of huge datasets essential for research on as interdisciplinary and complex topic as Neurosciences. Excellent intiative to collectively explore the depth of neuroscience important for advancing healthcare.","Workshops to the public interest groups for Communicating Science to the layman, Building stronger international inclusivity outside EU, Building an easily accessible common connecting platform for open discussion on each paper"
,Event Horizon Telescope,Capturing images of black holes,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,4,3,3,43,Organized but a bit lacking in term of collaboration,
,Science Feedback,"Ground truthing media, and science communication",5,5,5,5,Relevant references to research articles used in the review - but yet to figure out how to test reproducibility of those articles in topics like climate change and healthcare.,5,5,5,5,5,45,"Excellent organization and flow of information including publicly posted reviews by researchers. Reviews about both the overhyped and contradictory science information is well communicated even to the layman. Easy links to share on social media (fb, twitter) and reuse the feedback given. Diverse set of reviewers and collaborators from all across the globe.",
,Open Worm,OPEN source coding project to create a virtual organism ,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,4,47,"Good organization, very detailed information, access to articles, encourages citizens' development",
,Safecast,"Openly shared information on environmental radiation, based on volonteering.",5,5,not relevent,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,43,Nice useful colaborative project,Could not find where to give the feedback
,SenseBox,Toolkit for digital science for citizens to monitor environment,5,4,not relevent,5,5,4,5,3,5,4,40,Nice and very well etailed website with clear explatations,"A big part of information (shop, FAQ, forum) is in German only. Could not find te place where everybody shared their collected data."
,Kiron ,Online learning platform for refugees and disadvantaged communities,3.5,5,4.5,5,Articles published were cited and used by other authors,5,5,2.5,4,3.5,38,"Overall, their information has a good flow, I was happy that courses are free with certification as well. Their project is quite moving and even motivated me to want to join in on the movement. ",I would have liked to see a little more publication by the lecturers as well as a bio on them on the site or after registering just to establish their experiences etc
